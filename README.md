# UniFi Doorbell Tool

A set of scripts for customising your UniFi Doorbell G4 Pro. You can:

- Customise the chime played through the doorbell when somebody pushes the button
- Customise the screen animations displayed for key events

As well as copying/configuring the animations, the script can also generate
animations for you in the correct spritesheet format from an image sequence or
GIF.

## Requirements

- Node.js
- Yarn
- [sshpass][sshpass]

## Setup

1. Run `yarn` to install all dependencies
2. Set environment variables for `$G4_DOORBELL_SSH_PASSWORD` and
   `$G4_DOORBELL_HOSTNAME` with the recovery key and your doorbellâ€™s IP address
   respectively. You can get the recovery key from the UniFi Protect settings for
   your device.
